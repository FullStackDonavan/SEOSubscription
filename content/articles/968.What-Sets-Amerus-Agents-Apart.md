As a specially trained senior field underwriter, an Amerus agent is in your corner in a number of ways in which most ordinary insurance agents are simply not able to serve you.

“For example, I am a broker who is licensed by the state, so I have access to dozens of insurance carriers, not just one. When designing the right coverage options for my clients, I mine through hundreds of top rated insurance and financial vehicles to build solutions to protect both individuals and businesses and help create generational wealth,” says Regional Manager Nick Potter.

“Each family has unique needs,” continues Nick, “but one principle remains constant: I select the best coverage at the lowest possible rates available. It is my fiduciary responsibility to ensure the options I provide are not only adequate for your and your family’s specific needs, but remain affordable, even when life happens so you can remain protected, even if the fridge goes out.

Equally as important is my specialized process to make sure you can qualify even before we apply so you don’t jeopardize your ability to be covered due to a poorly trained agent’s ignorance about insurance underwriting guidelines.

Finally, you have my commitment to be your agent for life. Once we satisfy your initial need to protect your family from the foreseeable negative economic impact of illness, injury, or the loss of the provider in the home, we will work together to create a comprehensive long-term strategy to develop significant tax advantaged income sources, guaranteed double digit returns on your money while maintaining liquidity and ongoing access to the funds, safety and protection from market crashes, and the ability to leave a legacy for those you love.

As an Amerus agent, I am proud to be a financial services professional you can trust, and I look forward to serving you for years to come.”

This sentiment is echoed throughout the Amerus agent force. In today’s marketplace with rampant economic uncertainty, it is a true blessing to find an ally and an advocate.
