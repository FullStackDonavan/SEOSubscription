Filling prescriptions may be your most significant medical expense if you take many drugs or even a few costly ones. The Part D prescription drug program helps up to a point, but the premiums of its deductibles and copays, not to mention the higher costs of the doughnut hole if you fall into it, add up to outlays of cash many folks cannot afford. Main points about the “Extra Help” Program
Suppose you were receiving Medicaid before joining Medicare. If so, you will now get the drug coverage of yours from Part Ds extra Help program and not from Medicaid, even if you carry on and qualify for Medicaid.

In case you have full Medicaid coverage or perhaps supplemental security income if your state pays your Medicare premiums or maybe qualifies for a Medicaid medical spend-down program, you are eligible automatically for full extra Help.

If you do not qualify for full Extra help, you might be eligible for extra partial Help, which also provides coverage at lower costs than in the standard Medicare Part D program.

Additional Help is a lot more comfortable to apply for than many assistance programs, but you have to offer details of your income and resources or assets.

Everyone, whether qualifying for partial or full assistance, gets full drug coverage throughout the season. Nobody receiving Extra Help must deal with the dreaded doughnut hole.

Anybody with Extra Help can switch to a different Part D drug plan at any time of the year, no waiting until enrollment rolls around.

Getting Extra Help does not affect your eligibility for SSI or perhaps assistance that pays the costs of heating or possibly cooling your house.

Bear in mind that qualifying for Extra Help even automatically is just one step in the process. You will still have to sign up for a Part D drug plan to get your prescriptions covered.
